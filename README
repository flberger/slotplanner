======================

About
-----

slotplanner is a web app to manage a barcamp slot plan.

It serves a similar purpose to [Pentabarf](http://www.pentabarf.org/)
or [frab](https://frab.github.io/frab/) , but is much more lightweight
and easier to set up and administrate. It is aimed at BarCamps with
a comparatively small amount of contributions, i.e. some dozens.
